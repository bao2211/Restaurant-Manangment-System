# 🚀 Complete Docker Hub Upload Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Docker Image Built Successfully!

Your Docker image `rms-api-fixed:latest` has been built and is ready for upload.

## 🔐 Step 2: Login to Docker Hub

**You need to complete this step manually:**

```powershell
docker login
```

When prompted, enter:

- **Username**: Your Docker Hub username
- **Password**: Your Docker Hub password or access token

## 🏷️ Step 3: Tag Your Image

Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual Docker Hub username:

```powershell
# Tag with version
docker tag rms-api-fixed:latest YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:status-fix-v1.0

# Tag as latest
docker tag rms-api-fixed:latest YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:latest
```

## 📤 Step 4: Push to Docker Hub

```powershell
# Push the version tag
docker push YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:status-fix-v1.0

# Push the latest tag
docker push YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:latest
```

## Example Commands (Replace 'admin123' with your username):

```powershell
docker tag rms-api-fixed:latest admin123/rms-api-server:status-fix-v1.0
docker tag rms-api-fixed:latest admin123/rms-api-server:latest
docker push admin123/rms-api-server:status-fix-v1.0
docker push admin123/rms-api-server:latest
```

## 🌐 Step 5: Deploy to Production Server

Once uploaded to Docker Hub, deploy to your production server:

```bash
# On server 46.250.231.129:
docker pull YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:latest
docker stop rms-api-current || true
docker rm rms-api-current || true
docker run -d --name rms-api-current -p 8080:8080 YOURUSERNAME/rms-api-server:latest
```

## 🧪 Step 6: Test the Fix

After deployment, test the status field fix:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://46.250.231.129:8080/api/OrderDetail/order/HD16D450CE
```

**Expected result**: The response should now include the `"status": "Hoàn tất"` field!

## 📋 What You Need:

1. **Docker Hub Account** - Create at https://hub.docker.com if you don't have one
2. **Your Docker Hub Username** - This will be used in the image names
3. **Access to Production Server** - SSH access to 46.250.231.129

## 🎯 Summary
